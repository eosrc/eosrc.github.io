# Some more info about eosrc and [After Aquinas](https://github.com/eosrc/aa)

eosrc stands for Easy and Open Source. Someone wrote
that when you know assembly all programs are open
source. There is some truth to this but in a world
in a hurry, we simply don't have the time to read
tons of lines of assembly language.

After Aquinas is a project that explores how to use 
technology to support prayer. For centuries monks
copied manuscripts to earn money but also to meditate
on what they were writing down. Lectio Divina was
intermingled with this activity.

Prayer is work, it takes time and perseverance.
Programming is the same and we'd like to recall
that Knuth, when he introduced literate programming,
was imagining a "Pulitzer prize" for literate
programmers.
